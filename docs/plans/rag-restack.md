# Plan: rebuild the agent on Aegra, get basic chat working, then evaluate

> **Status: public surface live; evaluation publication in progress.** The Aegra runtime,
> retrieval layer, native assistant-ui, anonymous bootstrap, Luna guest contract, safety
> controls, and Production delivery are active at `syshin0116.vercel.app`. Dynamic
> specialists are implemented, but the final revision has only logged-out bootstrap,
> composer, and no-overflow browser evidence; a prior candidate's specialist run ended
> without a complete final answer. The remaining work is owner-reviewed RAG evaluation
> publication plus the post-launch provider billing, spend-stop, Scheduler, abuse,
> retention, recovery, and signed-in journey evidence below. Read
> [How to dispatch](#how-to-dispatch) first.

> **Read [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-chatbot-is-a-rag-evaluation-testbed.md) before touching
> anything here.** The purpose is comparing retrieval methods; the chat is an inspection
> surface. Simplification arguments that reason from corpus size are backwards.

> Runtime update, 2026-09-07: the current chat uses official dynamic subagents and
> `@assistant-ui/react-langchain` `useStreamRuntime`. The stream/load callbacks,
> custom client, and subscription restrictions described in the original P3 plan
> below are superseded by [Chat runtime](../reference/chat-runtime.md).

## What changed since the first draft

This plan has been rewritten twice, both times because a premise turned out to be wrong.
Recording that, because the corrections are the useful part:

1. The first version was "deploy the existing stack, then decide about Aegra and
   assistant-ui." Superseded when the owner confirmed **the existing agent data is
   disposable**, which removed the checkpoint-migration blocker.
2. The second version kept the agent layer at 96% unchanged. Superseded when the owner
   scoped it in as a rebuild too, and then again when the actual goal turned out to be
   **method evaluation, not blog search**.

The sequencing rule now is the owner's: **get basic chat working first.** Not because
chat is the product, but because it is the only thing that proves the whole infrastructure
chain actually connects.

## Implementation sequence

This is the historical build order. Current state is recorded in the table below.

```
P0  Aegra spike (local)              gates everything
P1  Rebuild the agent layer          retriever Protocol + correct BM25 + build-time mirror
P2  Deploy a restricted preview      fail-closed owner auth; not public yet
P3  assistant-ui, preview then cut over
    ─────────────────────────────────  deterministic native path complete; live gate remains
P4  Evaluation harness (eval/)       forks off P1's Protocol; can run in parallel from here
P4.5 QuickJS + subagent capability lab independent axes first, then bounded combination
P5  Public hardening                 anonymous identity, guard, GC, budget caps
P6  Go public                        PUBLICATION GATE
```

### Phase status as of 2026-08-15

| Phase | Repository status | Exact remaining gate |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Implemented and deployed: pinned Aegra runtime, AP v2 fixtures/codegen, PostgreSQL pool-recreation and isolation tests | No implementation gate remains |
| P1 | Implemented: shared retriever Protocol, 335-document published mirror, corrected fitted BM25, exact and field-weighted serving, native Deep Agents graph | No repository implementation gate remains; future methods extend the same contracts |
| P2 | Production delivery is active through immutable images, WIF, exact-main CI, a tagged no-traffic smoke revision, and 100% promotion; Preview remains intentionally disabled | Retain one real-Neon grant/maintenance proof if the staged Terraform foundation remains in scope |
| P3 | Native `useLangGraphRuntime`, official SDK `ThreadStream`/`MessageAssembler`, guest-safe projection, and AP v2 integration are implemented; the final Production revision has logged-out bootstrap, enabled-composer, and no-overflow browser evidence | Retain a completed provider-backed Luna and specialist answer on the final Production revision, plus one signed-in Production journey covering model selection and two Korean turns |
| P4 | Harness, first dense arm, and topic-review tooling implemented: the default provider-free sweep remains model-free; pinned multilingual E5 and BM25/dense RRF are explicit opt-in methods; a versioned topic seed, deterministic blind pool, checksum seal, finalizer, and dataset-selectable publication gate are present | Owner completion/sealing of `topic-smoke-v1` qrels and a publication-qualified digest-pinned run |
| P4.5 | Runtime, 2x2 harness, and manual Luna adapter implemented: bounded QuickJS and dynamic subagents share `RunBudget`; canonical Luna guests may use the server-declared specialists while QuickJS remains owner/eval-only | A complete retained v5 provider-backed quality/cost artifact plus owner/publication review for evaluation publication |
| P5 | Anonymous JWT/cookie, BotID Basic bootstrap, guard, spend ledger, retention/GC, quarantine/recovery, public wire, and UI are implemented; a prior Production candidate executed a specialist but ended without a complete final answer, while the final revision was observed passively | Retain a completed final-revision provider and specialist journey, deployed rate/concurrency/spend/retention/recovery evidence, input-count billing confirmation, and the provider-side spend stop |
| P6 | Live at `syshin0116.vercel.app`: anonymous Luna uses 500,000 µUSD/day and 53,837 µUSD/run for up to 8 calls at 768 output tokens, with a 64,000-token generation ledger and separate 128,000-token count-risk ledger; Preview remains fail closed | Complete the remaining P5 operational evidence and connect `syshin0116.dev` DNS if the custom domain is required |

The operational source of truth for those live gates is the
[GCP/Neon foundation](../runbooks/gcp-neon-foundation.md),
[Cloud Run delivery](../runbooks/cloud-run-delivery.md),
[web authentication](../runbooks/web-auth.md), and
[public anonymous rollout](../runbooks/public-anonymous-chat.md) runbooks. A repository
status update must not silently promote any unchecked live gate.

**The old P1 "close three content leaks" is deleted, not rescheduled.** All three fixes
patched files that P1 now deletes. Doing both would be the same work twice.

## Versions

Framework versions are declared in [agent/pyproject.toml](../../agent/pyproject.toml)
and [web/package.json](../../web/package.json), with resolved versions in the root uv
lock and web Bun lock. The [protocol lock](../../protocol/agent-protocol.lock.json)
records the matching upstream tags, commits, artifact hashes, and compatibility gaps.

The anonymous model is a separate fail-closed runtime contract, not an install-time
dependency. Production accepts only `openai:gpt-5.6-luna`, with
`reasoning.effort=none`, provider storage disabled, a 500,000 µUSD UTC-day ceiling,
and a 53,837 µUSD per-run provider-request reservation: 21,837 µUSD for the worst
64,000-token generation allocation across up to 8 calls at 768 output tokens per call,
plus 32,000 µUSD for the separate 128,000-token count-risk ledger.
Preview remains disabled, unpriced, and
OpenAI-free. Production is live with these committed values. Luna has no API Free tier,
so the application ledger remains a local safety boundary while provider-side spend-stop
and input-count billing evidence remain operational follow-ups.

**Already dropped:** `chromadb` (zero call sites).

**Dropped by the Aegra replacement:** direct `uvicorn`/`sse-starlette`, the `arq` extra,
`@langchain/react`, and `@langchain/langgraph`. FastAPI remains only for Aegra's supported
`http.app` extension; it owns no Agent Protocol endpoint.

## Current AI project tree

This is the current ownership map, not an exhaustive list of every test helper. Moving a
boundary requires updating this tree first. `protocol/generated/` is generated and
committed because compatibility tests consume the exact bindings; `agent/.index/` and
`eval/results/` are generated and never committed.

Not present yet, by design: serving graph expansion/fusion modules, additional
heavyweight `eval/src/blogeval/lab/` methods, and the reviewed
`topic-smoke-v1.review.json` plus
`topic-smoke-v1.json`. They land only with their method implementation or real owner
judgements. The superseded implementations under
`agent/src/agent/lib/` are gone; one unused package marker remains for a later hygiene
cleanup. `content/` remains an immutable build input and is never moved under `agent/`.

## CI/CD and release contract

The repository implements the following application, protocol, delivery, and dependency
workflows. The three stable required-check contexts are a separate branch contract below;
workflow files and reusable-workflow boundaries are also reviewed delivery inputs.

### Pull requests

- `ci/web` runs a frozen Bun install, generated-content prebuild, unit tests, lint,
  typecheck, the production build, pinned Chromium, and `bun run test:browser`. The
  Playwright suite exercises the native AP v2 fixtures, Korean IME, reconnect/reload,
  409/429 handling, BotID Basic bootstrap, 320/390/768/1440 px layouts, reduced motion,
  focus restoration, and Axe; CI uploads revision-bound browser evidence.
- `ci/agent`: root `uv sync --frozen`, Ruff, unit/contract/security tests, and the
  published-only mirror build. Its PostgreSQL 17 service runs the host integration
  suite, then CI builds the real Linux amd64 image, runs that same image's
  `python -m agent.migrate` against the same database, boots the image, verifies `/live`
  and `/ready`, and requires an unauthenticated AP v2 command to return 401. This bounded
  container smoke never sends a provider or model request.
- `ci/native-apv2`: the official JavaScript SDK talks to the real Aegra
  application/runtime and isolated PostgreSQL 17, covering the locked event/command
  dialect, persistence, HITL, inspection, reconnect, and the
  `rawPrivateStateObserved=false` sentinel.
- `ci/eval`: dataset-schema validation, deterministic metric fixtures, registry/fingerprint
  contract, then two byte-compared no-provider sweeps over the four default methods. Full
  paid sweeps are never a PR requirement.
- `protocol-compat`: fetch the Agent Protocol CDDL/OpenAPI revision recorded in
  `protocol/agent-protocol.lock.json`, regenerate bindings in a temporary directory, and
  fail on a diff. Replay committed content-block, tool, nested namespace, replay, error,
  and HITL fixtures through both Python and TypeScript consumers.
- The lock records upstream `@langchain/protocol` 0.0.18 and Aegra 0.9.25 with exact
  commits and artifact hashes. Aegra implements a tested subset of that draft AP v2
  event model at
  `POST /threads/{thread_id}/stream/events`, while upstream documents
  `POST /threads/{thread_id}/stream`. This path difference is explicit compatibility data,
  not hidden behind a misleading “fully conformant” label. The support matrix also records
  that Aegra has no v2 WebSocket route, dispatches only `run.start` and `input.respond`,
  ignores `input.respond` update/goto, lacks the other command families, and emits HITL
  input under `value` where the pinned binding expects `payload`. Dialect translation
  happens in one tested transport boundary; unsupported capabilities stay unsupported.
- Path filters include root `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `aegra.json`, `Dockerfile`,
  `protocol/**`, `scripts/**`, `content/**`, `agent/**`, `eval/**`, and `web/**`. A
  `content/**` change must rebuild both the web artifacts and the agent mirror.
- Required checks are exactly `ci/check`, `protocol/compat`, and `wiki/verify`. Component
  work remains path-aware behind the stable aggregate contexts. Never merge on red CI or
  let a path filter suppress one of those three contexts.

### Preview and production

- Vercel continues to create the web preview. The Cloud Run preview caller requires both
  `AGENT_CLOUD_RUN_ENABLED=true` and `AGENT_CLOUD_RUN_PREVIEW_ENABLED=true`. The repository
  has only the first flag; the Preview flag is absent, and Terraform creates no Preview
  Cloud Run service or jobs. The caller is therefore dormant until a separate reviewed
  change restores those resources and enables the flag. The current release workflow also
  does not revalidate the PR head or required CI after the `Agent Preview` approval, so
  that check must land before the caller can become a supported deployment path.
- GitHub authenticates to GCP through Workload Identity Federation; no long-lived service
  account JSON key is stored. Preview and production use isolated builders and Artifact
  Registry repositories. Each delivery attempt pushes a fresh git-SHA/run/attempt tag,
  records its registry digest, and deploys only that digest. The current builder explicitly
  disables provenance and SBOM generation. Never trust a pre-existing tag or rebuild between
  build, smoke, and promotion.
- `deploy-agent.yml` releases only the current reviewed `main` candidate whose exact
  `ci/check`, `protocol/compat`, and `wiki/verify` check-runs succeeded. The same
  digest-bound path now deploys the public Production revision.
- `agent-release.yml` deploys that digest to a no-traffic revision with a temporary
  `smoke` tag, verifies the deployed digest, `/live`, `/ready`, and an unauthenticated
  AP v2 `401`, then promotes the revision to 100% and removes the tag. It does not run
  migration, grant-probe, or maintenance jobs, an authenticated or provider-backed
  two-turn smoke, or an automated rollback.
- The PR container smoke proves packaging, migration, startup, health, and fail-closed
  routing without provider spend. It does not replace the P2/P3 deployed gates against
  real Neon, a real model provider, the browser Korean-IME journey, or capability-policy
  evidence.
- Cloud Run retains older revisions, but the repository has no rollback workflow.
  Recovery currently requires a separately approved manual traffic reassignment to a
  verified Ready revision. Database migrations must remain backward compatible with one
  previous application revision; destructive migrations require a separate ADR and
  backup/restore rehearsal.
- Use dedicated GitHub environments `Agent Preview` and `Agent Production`; the Vercel
  environments remain `Preview` and `Production`. Reviewers, self-review, and deployment
  branches are defined only in `.github/repository-governance.json` and checked by
  `scripts/verify_repository_governance.py`. The central contract keeps both production
  branch sets at exactly `{main}`.

### Staying current without surprise upgrades

- `dependency-audit.yml` runs weekly and on manual dispatch. It compares pinned Aegra,
  Agent Protocol schema revision, assistant-ui, LangGraph SDK, deepagents, and QuickJS
  against their latest upstream releases and reports compatibility/security changes.
- “Use latest” means **latest version proven by this repository's compatibility suite**,
  not an unpinned install. A version/protocol bump is its own PR: update pins and the
  protocol lock, regenerate fixtures/bindings, run P0 plus UI replay tests, then deploy by
  digest. Dependabot may open the PR but never auto-merge pre-1.0 runtime changes.

---

## P0 - Aegra spike, local `~1 day` `GATES EVERYTHING`

Turn "deepagents under Aegra is unverified" into a step. Aegra's repo has zero mentions of
deepagents.

- `aegra.json` at the repo root registers the static compiled graph, mandatory
  `agent.auth:auth`, and minimal `agent.http:app`. The custom FastAPI object becomes
  Aegra's application before native routers are included, so its pure-ASGI guard wraps
  native AP v2 commands without reimplementing them.
- The accepted spike used `FF_V2_EVENT_STREAMING=true`; its Aegra 0.9.24 event route
  returned 503 without this feature flag.
- The accepted spike pinned `aegra-api==0.9.24 aegra-cli==0.9.24`. The current tested
  runtime pin is 0.9.25 as recorded in the version table and protocol lock.
- Minimal `graph.py` rewrite: drop `checkpointer=`/`store=` and `_lazy_graph`. Aegra does
  `graph.copy(update={checkpointer, store})` per request, so a compiled graph registers
  as-is. **The `backend=` factory form is deprecated** (0.5.0, removal 0.7.0) - pass a
  `BackendProtocol` instance.
- The instance migration includes the current `StoreBackend(runtime, ...)` construction and
  namespace callback: both the runtime constructor and `context.runtime.config` access are
  deprecated for removal in deepagents 0.7. Resolve the namespace from the authoritative
  Aegra identity/config without any deprecated backend warnings; changing only
  `_build_backend` is incomplete.
- Run `uv run --project agent --frozen --env-file .env python -m agent.migrate` against a
  direct local/Neon Postgres endpoint, twice, then start with
  `uv run --project agent --frozen aegra serve --config aegra.json`. Production keeps
  `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP=false`.
- `scripts/smoke.py` on `langgraph_sdk.get_client`. **This becomes the permanent gate for
  every version bump.**
- Register a deterministic fixture graph alongside the real graph for CI only. It always
  emits one tool lifecycle, one nested namespace, and one interrupt, so protocol/HITL tests
  do not depend on a model choosing a particular action. The optional live Korean smoke is
  a separate check that may spend provider tokens.

**Accept:** a **two-turn** Korean conversation with at least one tool call completes over
the pinned Aegra AP v2 `POST /threads/{thread_id}/stream/events`, using content-block
deltas, tool and run lifecycle events, and nested namespaces where applicable. Within one
server lifetime, persist the last event/replay cursor, disconnect, reconnect, and prove that
no visible content is duplicated or lost. Separately close every database/checkpointer
pool, recreate the Aegra service graph objects, and prove checkpoint/thread state restores.
This local gate is a pool-recreation test, not a process-restart claim; a fresh deployed
process remains a P2 smoke requirement. Do not claim broker event replay survives a process
restart unless a test demonstrates it. Verify store/memory namespace isolation and that a
client-supplied `configurable.user_id` cannot change the trusted identity used by the backend:
Aegra preserves that forged field but separately injects
`langgraph_auth_user`/`server_info.user.identity`, which must be authoritative. With P0's
owner-auth server, prove resistance to the forged field and genuine cross-user isolation.
Exercise `run.start` and `input.respond` through `/threads/{thread_id}/commands`.

**Implemented evidence (2026-07-27):** Python 3.12 tests run the real Aegra
`LangGraphService` static-graph path with PostgreSQL 17, interrupt two identities, close
all pools, reinitialize, resume one identity, and prove the other checkpoint plus both real
`/memories/` namespaces survive unchanged despite a forged `configurable.user_id`. The
actual custom app returns 409 from the guard on the native command route and hides legacy
run/state/cron mutations with 404. Native thread DELETE returns 403 and leaves its
checkpoint unchanged. The provider-backed two-turn Korean smoke remains a deployment
acceptance check, not something the deterministic fixture claims to replace.

> The second turn is not decoration - it is the exact regression from Aegra issues #224

## P1 - Rebuild the agent layer `~3 days`

This phase was built from scratch against Deep Agents. The current tested pin is 0.7.5.

### P1.1 The retriever Protocol - do this first
- `agent/src/agent/retrieval/protocol.py`, **stdlib only, zero dependencies**. `Hit`,
  `Retrieval`, `Corpus`, `Retriever`, `Stage`, `Pipeline`.
- **It lives in `agent/`, not in `eval/`.** That is what makes it physically impossible for
  the chat and the harness to drift onto different interfaces - the failure ADR-0008
  follow-up 4 exists to prevent.
- `DocId` is **always** the content-relative posix path. `Retrieval.doc_ids()` collapses
  chunk hits to a deduped document ranking, which is the single place chunk-vs-document
  asymmetry is resolved so one qrel scores every method.
- `rank` is authoritative; `score` stays **raw and method-native**. Never normalise inside
  a retriever.
- `Stage` has the same shape as `Retriever`, so reranking, fusion, and graph expansion
  compose without special cases.
- `agent/src/agent/retrieval/registry.py`: `name -> factory` for **servable methods**.
  The chat reads this registry. The eval registry imports it, then adds heavyweight lab
  methods from `eval/src/blogeval/lab/` when one exists. The two registries may enumerate
  different sets, but a shared method ID must resolve to the same implementation/config
  fingerprint. CI checks that invariant.

### P1.2 The build-time published-only mirror
- `scripts/build_index.py` copies **only published posts** into `agent/.index/posts/`, and
  that mirror becomes the container's only content root. At content tree
  `71c5bbda097cc20be0cb15ca4666fd6917f89d5f`, the source has 336 Markdown files but the
  Nuartz-published set has **335**: basename-leading `_` files are excluded, including
  `AI/pdf-parser/_index.md`. The mirror, catalogue, graph, dictionary, and every fitted
  index must all use the same 335-document set.
- This is the publication boundary, and it is the whole reason it cannot be bypassed. The
  legacy agent relied on a runtime predicate that three code paths each had to remember;
  two forgot and the third was wrong. **In the rebuilt image a draft is not filtered, it
  is absent.**
- Fail closed: `draft` and `private` must be booleans when present; either `true` excludes
  the document and cannot be overridden. `published: false` also excludes, but the
  existing date/date-like-string `published` values are legacy publication timestamps,
  not booleans; preserve them as metadata. Reject other `published` types, and fail on an
  `unlisted` key until its semantics are explicitly decided. YAML parse errors, duplicate
  keys, and non-mapping frontmatter are build failures, not silent skips.
- Preserve the three currently public no-frontmatter documents through exact
  content-relative POSIX DocIds in owner-reviewed `agent/corpus-policy.toml`; a new
  no-frontmatter document or a stale allowlist entry is a build failure. Reject broken and
  out-of-tree symlinks. Preserve original Unicode paths, including U+200B, while rejecting
  NFC/case-fold collisions that would be ambiguous on another filesystem.
- P1.2 emits the mirror, `catalog.json`, corpus manifest/fingerprint, and resolved
  wikilink graph. P1.3 extends the same deterministic build with the Kiwi dictionary and
  fitted BM25 artifacts; it does not introduce a second corpus scan.
- CI test: build from fixtures containing public, draft, private, malformed, missing-
  frontmatter, legacy `published` dates, `published: false`, `_hidden.md`, unknown
  `unlisted`, Unicode/case collisions, and out-of-tree symlink cases; assert only the
  explicitly published fixture reaches `agent/.index/posts/`. Then walk the real mirror,
  require exactly 335 Markdown files, and fail if any excluded source appears. This makes
  the boundary auditable rather than aspirational.

> The corpus currently has zero `draft: true`, `private`, or boolean `published` values,
> but it has one Nuartz-hidden `_index.md` that the legacy Python agent indexed and three
> public no-frontmatter legacy files. The current mirror fixes that 336-vs-335 drift and
> fails closed on future leaks.

### P1.3 The corrected BM25 baseline `BLOCKER for everything in P4`
A broken baseline invalidates every comparison drawn against it. Three independent fixes,
all needed - see [the registry](../reference/retrieval-methods.md#the-korean-tokenizer-problem):

1. **Reviewed user dictionary with a complete candidate audit.** `add_user_word("도커",
   "NNP")` restores `['도커']`, verified, but tags alone do not: the corpus has `Docker`
   and no `도커` tag. Preserve every Hangul tag and corpus-attested `한글(ASCII)` alias as
   a sorted candidate with provenance in `dictionary-evidence.json`, but activate only
   owner-reviewed seeds after applying deny-wins policy. Never promote a candidate merely
   because it was collected: doing so turns grammatical forms such as `크다`, `없다`, and
   `검증하고` into NNPs and collapses useful compounds such as `개발+도구`. Include the
   policy, canonical dictionary bytes, evidence checksum, and exact Kiwi configuration in
   the method fingerprint. Pin Kiwi 0.23.2, its separately distributed model data 0.23.0,
   and the CoNg model with the default dictionary enabled and typo/Wikidata multiword
   dictionaries disabled; the exact `s:` channel preserves surface matches while
   component morphemes remain available. If Kiwi is unavailable, fail the build rather
   than silently serving a fallback under the same method ID.
2. **Drop `VV` and `VA` from the keep-list.** They are what survives when an unknown noun
   is mis-analysed, which is what turns a tokenization failure into a confident wrong
   answer instead of an empty result.
3. **Index a namespaced surface-form channel alongside morphemes**, so a term the
   dictionary has not caught up with still matches exactly without colliding with
   morphological tokens.
4. **Fit once at build time.** Persist document lengths, first-seen term-order IDFs, and
   sparse postings in deterministic SQLite. At runtime, re-verify the fitted artifact
   bytes at access time against the checksum and byte count pinned by the validated root
   manifest, then deserialize those verified bytes into one private in-memory SQLite
   connection. Never reopen the mutable fitted path after verification: an initialized
   retriever has no post-init file dependency, while a new runtime fails closed if the
   artifact drifts. Do not ship raw token documents or construct `BM25Okapi` while
   serving. The registry identity path may reread and checksum the artifact bytes, but it
   neither deserializes the database nor creates a tokenizer; creating one registered
   retriever creates exactly one SQLite snapshot and one Kiwi tokenizer instead of
   fitting/loading the method twice.

Also remove the `score / max(scores)` normalisation: it forces the top hit to exactly 1.000
for **any** query including nonsense.

**Accept:** executable tests, not inspection, against a committed literal-term qrel
manifest pinned to the corpus tree. On the published 335-document corpus, the legacy
pre-fix tokenizer's `도커` recall@13 is 3/13 and the corrected current method reaches
13/13; raw scores match
`BM25Okapi` without normalisation, ties are stable by DocId, serialized/load-time results
are identical, the fitted DB is byte-deterministic within the pinned build target, clean
Linux registry runtime `VmHWM` stays below 550 MiB, and absent, zero-score, and
negative-score terms produce no hit under the documented positive-score-only contract.
Build and evaluate the deployable artifact in the same pinned Linux x86_64 image; Kiwi's
optimized kernels can produce small cross-architecture floating-point differences even
when package and model versions match. The previously quoted macro
recall 0.323 → 0.605 has no versioned queryset or qrels in the repository and is **not a
gate**. Add a macro gate only with owner-reviewed `topic-smoke-v1` in P4.

### P1.4 Native composition
- **No content backend route.** `ls`/`glob`/`grep`/`read_file` are in the compiled ToolNode
  **unconditionally**, whatever you pass as `tools=` - they are only dangerous if a backend
  route points them at content. Deleting the `/blog/` route removes the leak class.
- **Mount `/skills/`** on a read-only FilesystemBackend and pass `skills=["/skills/"]`.
  The legacy absolute host path went through `SkillsMiddleware`, missed every backend
  route, and fell through to `StateBackend`. The mounted route now loads the consolidated
  workflow skill with zero warnings.
- **Collapse six SKILL.md files into one workflow skill.** Six files each restating one
  tool's docstring is duplication under the upstream model - skills are for task
  instructions too large for the prompt, discovered by progressive disclosure.
- `FilesystemPermission` (new in 0.6.0) replaces the 45-LOC `ReadOnlyFilesystemBackend`
  subclass. **It cannot express "frontmatter lacks draft"** - it is pure path globbing.
  That job belongs to P1.2, not here.
- **Read the trusted identity from `configurable["langgraph_auth_user"]`, never
  `configurable["user_id"]`.** Aegra sets `user_id` with `setdefault`, so a client
  overrides it and reaches another user's memory namespace. Better still,
  `runtime.server_info.user.identity` works inside middleware with no escape hatch. The
  static StoreBackend namespace callable reads this trusted runtime identity directly.
- `agent/src/agent/auth.py` carries the owner token flow, the P5 anonymous extension, and a
  mandatory `AGENT_AUTH_SECRET` length check. Never deploy an Aegra graph with no auth
  file.
- Disable native thread deletion with `@auth.on.threads.delete`. Aegra 0.9.25 deletes
  metadata without checkpoints and exposes no supported atomic extension, so there is no
  honest user-facing delete operation. The implemented admin GC/retention job remains a
  separate privileged operation.
- Delete: `read_only_backend.py`, `result_formatter.py`, `ripgrep_search.py` (shells out
  for a 2.4 MB corpus while its own in-process fallback is correct), and 32 LOC of dead
  code in `prompts.py`.

**Accept:** a test fails if a spoofed `configurable.user_id` changes the resolved memory
namespace; skills load with zero warnings; the graph compiles with a stable node set.
The new retrieval, graph, and auth modules are explicitly listed as retained files for the
later server deletion, so a LOC-based cleanup cannot remove them accidentally.

## P2 - Deploy a restricted Cloud Run preview `~1.5 days`

This was the first-deployment phase, when the service was **not yet a public chatbot**.
P1's fail-closed owner auth was the
application boundary so the browser preview can reach Cloud Run without creating a second
IAM-token exchange. IAM and ingress restriction may be added where compatible, but an
unlisted URL is never an access-control boundary. Aegra without the registered auth file
is fail-open under one shared `anonymous` identity, so deployment must refuse to proceed
if auth registration or its secret is missing.

**Repository status:** the native image build and Production release path are active.
Terraform still declares migration, grant-probe, and maintenance jobs, but normal CD does
not execute them and the repository has no automated rollback. Production is live and
Preview remains closed. Retained real-Neon job evidence is still required if the staged
Terraform foundation remains in scope.

- Dockerfile is greenfield - Aegra's own copies `libs/aegra-api/...` paths that do not
  exist here. `python:3.12-slim-bookworm`.
- **Two Neon free projects in a US region** ([ADR-0007](../adr/0007-postgres-on-neon-split-projects.md)):
  one for the agent, one for Auth.js. Zero code changes - both sides read `DATABASE_URL`.
  **Neon project regions are fixed at creation**, so this is only available now.
- Set `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP=false` on every Cloud Run revision. Before deployment, run
  a separate one-shot job from the same immutable image digest with a separately held
  elevated direct Neon `DATABASE_URL` and the command `python -m agent.migrate`; require
  success before creating or updating the service revision. That entrypoint upgrades Aegra
  metadata and creates the LangGraph checkpointer/store tables. Never expose the migration
  credential to the runtime.
- Give the service a separate least-privileged direct Neon URL. Reject `-pooler` hostnames
  before startup in accordance with ADR-0007, and exercise both async and synchronous
  database paths against the isolated real-Neon branch before a Production schema change.
  The pinned Aegra runtime still invokes the LangGraph saver/store
  `setup()` methods during lifespan startup, so the separated runtime role temporarily
  needs the exact schema-local idempotent DDL those calls exercise in addition to narrow
  DML. Treat the grant shape as a real-Neon deployment gate: startup/restart and
  checkpoint/store operations must succeed while cross-schema, role-management, and
  administrative operations fail. Tighten the role to DML-only when Aegra exposes a
  supported no-DDL startup.
- Deploy initially with 1 GiB memory, `cpu_idle=true`, `startup_cpu_boost=true`, a
  300-second timeout, `max_instances=1`, concurrency 8, a **dedicated minimal service
  account**, and an application entrypoint fixed to one server worker. Keep
  `REDIS_BROKER_ENABLED=false` and `BG_JOB_MAX_RETRIES=0`. Turn Postgres pool knobs down
  (Aegra opens up to ~50 connections by default). Cloud Run's 512 MiB default is too close
  to the measured ~373 MiB clean Linux x86_64 BM25 runtime before Aegra, API, database
  pools, and concurrent requests are loaded.
- Verify the owner token succeeds and an anonymous or forged token receives 401/403 on the
  exact streaming route used by the frontend, not only on a metadata route.
- `max_instances=1` and one application worker are both load-bearing: either setting
  exceeding one splits P5's in-process guard.
- Verify the OpenAI project's enforced spend stop. Grep startup logs for Aegra's
  data-not-isolated warning.

**Accept:** the same-digest direct-URL `python -m agent.migrate` job succeeds before deployment;
the service starts with `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP=false`, rejects `-pooler` hostnames, and
proves its separate direct runtime URL and the required grant/denial matrix against real
Neon across the exercised async/sync database paths;
`/live` returns 200, `/ready` is healthy, and `scripts/smoke.py` passes with signed-in
Production owner credentials. The same streaming requests without credentials or with a
forged subject receive 401/403; cold-start-to-first-token and full-image cold-start plus concurrency-8
memory are measured and recorded without approaching the 1 GiB limit. Starting a fresh
revision from the same image digest restores persisted checkpoint/thread/memory state. Do
not continue if graph routes are anonymously reachable, a pooler endpoint is configured,
the process settings split the guard, or measured memory leaves inadequate headroom.

## P3 - assistant-ui `~3 days`

Preview URL first. The native assistant-ui implementation and the WEB-B guest-only network
projection are merged. Production now serves WEB-B anonymous Luna chat while Preview
remains fail closed.

### P3.1 UI contract

The chatbot remains part of the home-page experience and now has a full-height focused
mode instead of fitting every control into the hero. Desktop uses a three-zone shell;
mobile uses one conversation surface with sheets for threads and run detail.

```text
web/components/assistant/
├── chat-section.tsx               # owner/anonymous entry boundary

    ├── ime.ts
    ├── focus-restoration.ts
    └── error-state.ts
```

- WEB-A signed-out view explains that the preview is owner-only. The WEB-B BotID Basic,
  bodyless cookie-resume, example-prompt, privacy/AI-copy, and new-conversation UI exists but is
  reachable only when the server and browser public flags are deliberately enabled after
  P5/P6.
- Message answers render citations inline and a source list below. Retrieval method and
  corpus revision are visible in a compact run-details disclosure, not mixed into prose.
- Tool activity collapses into a timeline by default. Retrieval shows the exact bounded
  query/method/hit/stage/source fields emitted by the server. QuickJS or subagent-specific
  cards appear only after a reviewed protocol event exists; generic tool/nested lifecycle
  must not be relabelled as a capability the run did not prove. Internal chain-of-thought
  is never displayed; guest response bytes additionally pass through the server-side
  projection that drops reasoning/thinking blocks before the browser sees them.
- Capability authorization is server-owned. The former skill-restriction chips and fake
  checkpointed system messages are gone. Client config cannot grant QuickJS or arbitrary
  subagents. Signed-in users with `model:select` may request only Luna, Terra, or Sol;
  anonymous model input is removed before dispatch and remains Luna-pinned.
- Required states: empty, token minting, ready, streaming, tool running, subagents in
  parallel, interrupted, reconnecting/replaying, stopped, rate-limited, busy-thread,
  expired anonymous thread, server error, and offline. Every state has Korean copy and a
  single safe next action.
- Desktop target: thread rail 280 px, flexible conversation, optional 320 px run-detail
  drawer. Under 1024 px the detail drawer becomes a sheet; under 768 px the thread rail is
  also a sheet. Composer remains visible above the mobile keyboard and safe-area inset.
- Accessibility gate: full keyboard operation, visible focus, semantic live regions without
  announcing every token, reduced-motion support, contrast compliance, labelled icon
  buttons, and focus restoration after sheets/dialogs/HITL.

### P3.2 Runtime implementation

- Use assistant-ui's native `useLangGraphRuntime`, but do **not** use
  `unstable_createLangGraphStream`: it calls legacy `client.runs.stream`. Supply a stream
  callback backed by the official `@langchain/langgraph-sdk` 1.9.28
  `Client.threads.stream`, `ThreadStream`, and `MessageAssembler`.
- Call `ThreadStream.submitRun/respondInput`. These emit Aegra's supported
  `run.start`/`input.respond` wire commands without the older SDK methods' implicit
  wildcard `values` projection.
- Open exactly one application content subscription:
  `channels=[messages,lifecycle,input,tools,custom]`, `namespaces=[[]]`, `depth=0`.
  Never subscribe to `values` or `updates`, and never union nested messages into this
  connection. The SDK separately opens a physical lifecycle watcher connection with only
  `channels=[lifecycle,input]`; it is outside the content union.
- Use bounded local projections for root messages, citations, inspection events, and HITL.
  The local reducer drops system/tool/reasoning/open-state fields from UI state. Inspection detail is
  `delivery=live-run-only`; reload must say the exact detail is unavailable.
- Use the official SDK client for cancellation, metadata, state, and history. Do not add a
  custom REST facade. Keep Edit/Regenerate/branch mutation/delete visibly disabled until
  the backend supports their required semantics.
- **WEB-B network boundary, implemented:** guest state/history/metadata/run/command JSON
  and complete SSE frames pass through a fail-closed server projection before response
  bytes leave the process. It validates the bounded public schemas, fixes the SDK input
  watcher at root/depth zero, removes reasoning/system/tool arguments/tool output/raw
  errors and unreviewed interrupts, and revalidates the inspection event. Owner responses
  remain native and unprojected. This satisfies the repository network prerequisite; it
  does not satisfy P5's deployed abuse, retention, spend, or browser gates.
- In `load()`, read `state.interrupts` **first** - Aegra returns interrupts as a top-level
  field, so the quickstart's `state.tasks[0].interrupts` is the wrong read here.
- Async `onRequest` token hook with a 60s margin. Capturing the token once at mount 401s
  mid-conversation.
- `remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm, remarkBreaks]}` with components memoised at module scope.
  **remark-breaks is load-bearing for Korean.**
- **Korean IME: verify with a Playwright test, do not assume.** Highest-risk regression.
- Cut over and delete the named legacy browser transport modules and vendored prompt-kit.
  Do not use an LOC target as deletion scope. Explicitly retain
  `agent/src/agent/retrieval/**`, the rebuilt graph, auth/identity code, and their tests.

**Accept:** a full multi-turn Korean conversation against deployed owner-authenticated
Aegra over AP v2; reload restores visible messages while truthfully marking prior
inspection detail unavailable; the two SSE connections match the exact channel filters
above; the actual JavaScript SDK ↔ Aegra ↔ isolated PostgreSQL 17 fixture proves
`rawPrivateStateObserved=false`, canonical inspection, HITL, tool/nested lifecycle,
message assembly, persistence, and connection return. This sentinel assertion is a
state-channel regression, not a general proof that future input payloads are public-safe
or that chain-of-thought cannot traverse a root message event.
Desktop, 768 px, 390 px, and 320 px browser evidence covers console/network/a11y,
reduced-motion, focus restoration, and Korean IME. No production import or network call
uses legacy `/runs/stream`; unsupported mutations are visibly disabled. These deterministic
fixtures and browser tests are implemented in CI. The first full deployed
owner-authenticated Korean conversation remains the P2/P3 operational acceptance gate.

### ✅ Deterministic native chat path works here; live provider acceptance remains

---

## P4 - Evaluation harness `~4 days` `parallelisable from P1`

The actual deliverable. Forks off P1's Protocol and can proceed alongside P2 and P3.

- **`eval/` as a uv workspace member** next to `agent/`. The split line is **servable vs
  not**: a method that could run on Cloud Run lives in `agent/src/agent/retrieval/`; a
  method needing torch, a 2 GB checkpoint, or a JVM belongs in `eval/src/blogeval/lab/`. Both
  satisfy the same Protocol. The eval registry extends the agent registry; the agent never
  imports `eval/`. Promoting a lab method means moving its implementation and registering
  the same method ID/fingerprint in the servable registry. This keeps the image slim
  without forking the interface.
- **Bootstrap qrel candidates from the 164 aliased `[[target|alias]]` occurrences in the
  published corpus.** The alias is the author's own Korean surface form for a target
  document - free known-item evidence that no public corpus has. Resolve, deduplicate, and
  record exclusions before calling them gold; use them before spending anything on
  LLM-generated queries.
- Keep two versioned query-set contracts rather than mixing their metrics:
  `known-item-alias-v1` maps each alias to one target and headlines Hit@k and MRR;
  `topic-smoke-v1` will contain manually reviewed multi-document qrels and headline
  recall@k. Its committed seed contains queries and the exact sparse/dense/fusion pool
  policy, but no labels. The blind-pool manifest records the generator/version, exact
  method fingerprints, corpus tree, and pending-vs-reviewed state; only an exact
  checksum-sealed owner review can materialize the ordinary query-set manifest. The BM25
  macro-recall regression waits for that reviewed dataset.
- Pin the corpus by **git tree sha of `content/`**. The harness never reads live `content/`.
- **Report `coverage` alongside recall@k, always.** The published-corpus wikilink graph is
  sparse, so a graph method that declines to answer on most queries would otherwise look
  strong only where it fires. Record its exact node/edge coverage in the generated corpus
  manifest rather than copying statistics from the former 336-document agent corpus.
- **Do not headline nDCG.** On four smoke queries nDCG@10 read 1.000 for every one while
  recall@10 ranged 0.23 to 0.77. It saturates when relevant-sets are large and ungraded.
- Local `results/<tree-sha>/` JSON is the **system of record**; LangSmith's free tier keeps
  traces 14 days and caps at ~3 full sweeps a month. Use it as a comparison UI, not storage.
- A committed pytest regression gate on macro recall@10, added only after
  `topic-smoke-v1` qrels receive owner relevance review. Until then, the literal-term
  Docker qrel and synthetic tokenizer contracts are the P1.3 regression gates.
- Emit a Markdown leaderboard and SVG plots, so results drop into a blog post without
  retyping. This matches the repo's existing `.mmd` → `.svg` diagram convention.

**Implemented evidence (2026-08-01):** `eval/` is a root uv-workspace member and the
default CLI sweep runs `bm25`, `bm25-field-weighted`, `char-ngram`, and
`rrf-bm25-char-ngram`. CI generates and validates the 90-qrel known-item dataset, executes
the four-method sweep twice on its frozen Linux runner, verifies each run, and
byte-compares its JSON, Markdown, SVG, and manifest projections. The opt-in
`dense-multilingual-e5-small` and `rrf-bm25-dense-multilingual-e5-small` methods make the
first experiment executable with an exact cached model revision. The topic-review CLI
separately generates the seed-pinned deterministic blind candidate pool, replays registry
fingerprints, refuses incomplete owner decisions, checksum-seals explicit review
provenance, and only then finalizes `blogeval-queryset-v3` topic qrels with exact pooling
provenance. Publication candidate schema v2 binds a closed dataset choice plus the exact
dataset ID/checksum. No owner judgements or dense result are committed, so the
publication gate remains open.

**Accept:** one full sweep over at least three methods produces a leaderboard, a
per-query table, and plots, reproducibly, from a pinned corpus and a versioned query-set
manifest. Reports label known-item and topic metrics separately.

**First experiment:** corrected BM25 vs one dense method vs their RRF fusion, over the
`known-item-alias-v1` query set, reporting Hit@k, MRR, and coverage. Small on purpose -
its job is to prove the harness, not to settle anything.

## P4.5 - QuickJS and dynamic-subagent capability lab `~3 days`

These are **agent-capability experiments, not retrieval methods**. Keep their results out
of the retrieval leaderboard so orchestration gains cannot be mistaken for retriever
quality. The framework split is deliberate: Deep Agents owns planning, skills, and dynamic
delegation; LangGraph/Aegra owns persistence and streaming; LangChain middleware supplies
the bounded code interpreter.

### P4.5.1 QuickJS, independently

- Add `CodeInterpreterMiddleware` using `langchain-quickjs==0.3.5`. All execution paths are
  async: never call sync `ctx.eval()` or sync `invoke()`.
- Start in eval and owner tiers only. No environment, filesystem, or network bridge; expose
  only the minimum pure-data helpers needed to inspect and transform retrieved results.
- Enforce wall-clock timeout, memory ceiling, source/input size, output bytes, and one
  interpreter session at a time per run. Truncation and timeout are structured tool results,
  not worker failures.
- Use it for tasks where code is materially useful: aggregate retrieval results, compare
  ranked lists, calculate metrics, transform tables, and validate citations. Do not invoke
  it for ordinary prose questions merely because it exists.

### P4.5.2 Dynamic subagents, independently

- Configure named, read-only specialists such as `retrieval-researcher`,
  `evidence-checker`, and `comparison-synthesizer`, plus the general-purpose subagent for
  genuinely novel decompositions. The main agent chooses at runtime whether and how to
  delegate through `task`.
- Subagents are stateless. Every dispatch must contain the complete question, allowed
  corpus/method scope, expected output schema, and stopping condition. Custom subagents
  receive their fixed skill preloaded through child `SkillsMiddleware`; they do not
  inherit the main agent's skills or spend a model tool call loading it.
- Give specialists the smallest tool set they need. They return evidence and ranked IDs;
  only the main agent writes the final visitor-facing answer.
- Add an atomic `RunBudget` outside the model loop. Reserve before every model, tool, and
  `task` dispatch; cap task count, fan-out, depth, tokens, and elapsed time. A nested
  subagent shares the parent's remaining budget rather than receiving a fresh allowance.
- Treat `snapshot()` as observation only. Capability evaluation must call the atomic
  `finalize()` boundary, which terminalizes the run, rejects any open model or task
  reservation, enforces `elapsed < limit`, and returns an immutable frozen snapshot.
  Provider usage comes only from middleware-parsed response metadata, never executor
  observations. The normalized pricing buckets are uncached input, output, cache-read
  input, and cache-write input. The initial Anthropic fixture combines its five-minute and
  one-hour cache-creation buckets when those TTL details are present. If a required
  usage/detail field is absent,
  negative, unknown, or internally inconsistent, `provider_usage_complete` is false and
  every aggregate provider bucket is `null`; no zero-valued usage is fabricated.
- The initial owner-only experiment used max depth 1 and max two subagents per run.
  Production now keeps depth 1, permits two concurrent tasks, and applies the shared guest
  model, tool, token, elapsed-time, rate, concurrency, and daily spend ceilings.

### P4.5.3 Combine only after both standalone gates pass

- Do **not** expose `task()` as a QuickJS bridge initially. Dispatch from inside an eval
  bypasses the normal tool-calling/HITL path, and `max_ptc_calls` does not cover it.
- The first combined experiment may let the main agent delegate to specialists and let an
  individual specialist use QuickJS, but every reservation still goes through the shared
  `RunBudget`. No `Promise.all(task(...))` bridge.
- Run a 2×2 experiment over `capability-tasks-v1`: QuickJS off/on × subagents off/on. Report
  task success, citation correctness, latency, model/tool/task calls, tokens, and estimated
  cost. This determines where each capability helps instead of enabling both by default.

**Accept:** deterministic fixtures prove timeout/memory/output limits, stateless subagent
instructions, explicit skill assignment, shared nested budgets, max depth/fan-out, and
failure propagation. The 2×2 report is reproducible. The owner/eval test runtime can
exercise both capabilities. This was the owner-only P4 acceptance gate. Anonymous access now uses the
bounded P5/P6 policy and the same server-declared, read-only specialists.
This run-local finalization evidence does not replace P5's lower guest policy,
per-identity/global daily dollar ledger, rate limit, or provider-side spend cap.

**Implemented evidence (2026-08-01):** the owner graph exercises native bounded QuickJS
and native Deep Agents `task`; the exact off/on x off/on experiment compiles the
production graph in all four arms with fresh identities, empty per-attempt persistence,
and one shared finalized budget. The provider-free fixture remains
`synthetic-provider-free`. A separate manual adapter now fixes OpenAI Responses
`gpt-5.6-luna`, exact SDK/pricing identity, provider-native input counting and usage
settlement, a required paid-run acknowledgement, and an explicit worst-case
generation-token cost cap. The paid path now binds the published-index manifest tree to
the task set, compiles and advertises only `evidence-checker` in the native task surface,
requires and records exactly one delegation for each subagent-required cell, and records
`/responses/input_tokens` as structured billing excluded from the generation-only
ceiling. Run schema v5 additionally records matching root call/`ToolMessage` completion
boundaries, requires exactly one QuickJS call only for required cells, proves the
combined `eval completion → later task call` chronology, and reconciles the root-tool
trace exactly while reporting generic compiled-child calls separately from root
QuickJS/task calls. An earlier schema-v4 local diagnostic completed all 16 cells, but it
does not satisfy the superseding v5 evidence contract. Two bounded v5 attempts reached
the combined cell and then failed closed; neither produced an artifact. The first exposed
the child-tool accounting distinction now encoded by `delegated_tool_calls`, while the
second ended before a complete combined observation. No v5 quality, result, or exact cost
is claimed, and another paid attempt requires separate explicit owner acceptance.
Official input-token-count request pricing is undocumented and requires a separate
acknowledgement. Any complete future output is deliberately
`provider-backed-local-unattested` and is not a signed publication. Production guests may
use the bounded server-declared specialists, while QuickJS remains owner/eval-only.

## P5 - Public hardening `implemented; post-launch evidence remains`

Nothing here is optional. Full detail in
[`public-exposure.md`](../research/public-exposure.md).

**Repository status:** the controls below are implemented, tested, and active for the
Production anonymous path. The retained deployment evidence proves availability and the
cheap unauthenticated boundary. It does not yet prove input-count billing, the provider
account spend stop, first bounded Scheduler execution, or deployed abuse, retention, and
recovery behavior.

- **The governing constraint:** authorization must not depend on `@auth.on.*` dispatch.
  Legacy streaming paths skip handlers, and AP v2 thread-stream/commands coverage must be
  proven by protocol fixtures rather than assumed. The SQL identity predicate plus outer
  ASGI guard is the boundary; handlers are defence in depth.
- Extend P1's `agent/src/agent/auth.py` with PyJWT anonymous claims; keep the import-time
  `len(AGENT_AUTH_SECRET) >= 32` assertion. Aegra with no auth file is **fail-open**, where
  this deployment must remain fail-closed.
- Anonymous identity: Vercel BotID Basic-gated, bodyless `POST
  /api/anonymous-agent-token` mints `anon:<uuid4>` and an httpOnly session cookie.
  Aegra's `WHERE user_id = identity` predicate isolates them automatically. Return
  `is_authenticated: True` even for guests.
- `GuestRunGuard` as a **pure ASGI class**, not `BaseHTTPMiddleware` - the latter interferes
  with sse-starlette's disconnect detection, which is how `on_disconnect="cancel"` works.
  Per-identity token bucket (429) and per-`(identity, thread)` busy set (409).
- Tier differences go in **the model instance and backend routes**, never the middleware
  list - Aegra requires identical topology across access contexts. `wrap_model_call` adds
  no nodes, so anything expressible there is free to vary.
- `/admin/gc` plus the dedicated maintenance job, quarantine, stale-run recovery, and
  Terraform-owned Cloud Scheduler. **Deleting a thread does not delete its checkpoints** -
  sweep children before parents. Neon free has no `pg_cron`; the approved production
  Scheduler desired state is active. Its exact plan, apply, and first bounded execution
  remain post-launch evidence.
- Per-run model/token limits and a durable UTC-day micro-dollar ledger are implemented for
  the fixed `openai:gpt-5.6-luna` guest contract. Production now owns the exact model,
  500,000/53,837 µUSD ceilings, anonymous Agent flag, and numeric OpenAI secret
  reference while Preview remains absent/disabled. The per-run ceiling adds a separately
  capped 128,000-token count-risk ledger, priced at the highest input bucket, to the
  64,000-token generation allocation across up to 8 calls at 768 output tokens per call
  because count billing is undocumented. This is not
  a documented provider price or hidden-token bound. Input-count billing confirmation,
  provider-account spend protection, and the
  enabled Production issuance flags do not replace those remaining operational proofs.
- Public capability policy keeps retrieval and the existing server-declared dynamic
  specialists available to canonical Luna guests. Guest children remain stateless,
  depth-one, read-only, and inside the shared model, tool, token, time, concurrency, and
  daily spend budgets. QuickJS, arbitrary subagent definitions, nested delegation, and a
  QuickJS-to-`task` bridge remain unavailable to visitors.

---

## P6 - Public rollout `live; post-launch acceptance remains`

Production is public at `syshin0116.vercel.app`. The checks below are the remaining
post-launch acceptance work, not a claim that anonymous access is still disabled.

- Keep Production available as a personal-blog testbed that **any visitor can try without
  signing in**. Vercel BotID Basic establishes an isolated anonymous subject through a
  bodyless bootstrap; it is an abuse gate, not an account wall. Preview stays closed until
  it receives a separate reviewed public-test contract.
- Verify the P1.2 mirror gate and the P5 guard on the **deployed** service, by actually
  exceeding the rate limit from a browser and firing two concurrent submits on one thread.
- Confirm the separate administrative retention/GC job measurably reduces orphaned
  checkpoint row count; it does not enable user-facing thread deletion.
- Verify the implemented quarantine, heartbeat, and stale-run recovery on the deployed
  revision: with `REDIS_BROKER_ENABLED=false` there is no upstream lease reaper, so the
  repository-owned fence must recover an instance killed mid-run without double execution.
- Decide LangSmith tracing before activating it; traces carry full prompts and full
  retrieved content.
- Watch guest and signed-in OpenAI spend separately every day for week one.

## Risks

| | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| `HIGH` | **Same-thread run serialization is lost.** Aegra parses `multitask_strategy` and never reads it. This reverses the 2026-07-11 decision | The implemented guest busy set, quarantine, and recovery fence remain valid only with one application worker and `max-instances=1`; verify both on the deployed revision |
| `HIGH` | Auth dispatch differs across legacy and AP v2 streaming/commands paths | Protocol fixtures test every production endpoint; SQL identity predicate plus outer ASGI guard is the boundary. Pin `aegra-api >= 0.9.7` |
| `HIGH` | Client-supplied `configurable.user_id` wins over the server's | The graph reads the authoritative server runtime identity; PostgreSQL isolation tests retain a forged field and prove it cannot cross namespaces |
| `HIGH` | Aegra thread deletion strands checkpoints and cannot commit both stores atomically | Native DELETE is fail-closed with 403. Do not expose a faux-safe route; design admin GC separately |
| `HIGH` | Unbounded LLM spend from anonymous traffic. Aegra supplies no sufficient public rate/budget boundary | Production reserves 500,000 µUSD/day and 53,837 µUSD/run; the run value combines the 64,000-token generation allocation across up to 8 calls at 768 output tokens per call with a separate 128,000-token aggregate count-risk ledger priced at the highest input bucket, but is not a documented provider hard bound. Production issuance is active, so input-count billing and a separately verified OpenAI account cap remain urgent operational evidence. Luna has no Free tier |
| `MED` | **Regressing the corrected baseline.** A tokenizer or fitted-artifact change would invalidate every comparison | P1.3 executable literal-term, raw-score, determinism, memory, and registry tests remain required |
| `MED` | Pre-1.0 churn. Aegra and assistant-ui compatibility can change between patch releases; three `unstable_` assistant-ui options remain on the happy path | Exact pins, committed lockfiles, protocol/browser replay, and `smoke.py` as the bump gate |
| `MED` | Eval cost creep - embedding N models × M queries × K retrievers plus judge calls | Cache embeddings by fingerprint; local results as system of record; `upload_results=False` while iterating |
| `MED` | The eval and the chat drift onto different retriever contracts | The Protocol and method fingerprint contract live in `agent/`; eval extends, rather than replaces, the servable registry |

## Resolved decisions

1. **Region:** dedicated GCP project and Cloud Run use `asia-southeast1`; the Neon
   projects remain in their reviewed US region.
2. **Model policy:** the guest contract accepts only `openai:gpt-5.6-luna` at the reviewed
   500,000/53,837 µUSD ceilings. Signed-in users with `model:select` may choose the exact
   OpenAI GPT-5.6 Luna, Terra, or Sol IDs through the same bounded Responses contract.
3. **Guest persistence:** an httpOnly anonymous-session cookie resumes the pseudonymous
   subject; the bodyless BotID Basic verdict is never retained.
4. **Version policy:** use the repository-tested exact pins, including
   `langgraph==1.2.10` and `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres==3.1.1`, with compatibility
   tests documented.
5. **Client controls:** the old skill-restriction chips and fake system messages are
   dropped. Retrieval and capability authorization is server-owned. Model selection is
   an exact signed-in allowlist, not a generic client capability field.
6. **Web authentication:** keep Auth.js with GitHub/Google OAuth on Neon Postgres; Neon
   Auth is not part of the authentication boundary.

## Open decisions and live gates

- Retain and qualify the pinned multilingual-E5 first experiment; selecting,
  fingerprinting, and locally replaying the model path are complete, but no local result
  can substitute for the owner-reviewed, publication-qualified evidence gate.
- Whether a genuinely free guest provider path will replace the current owner-approved
  non-zero Luna budget.
- Cold-start-to-first-token and full-image memory on the real revision. Those measurements
  decide whether `min-instances=1` is worth recurring cost.
- Whether public LangSmith tracing is enabled; traces contain full prompts and retrieved
  content, so an explicit privacy decision must land before tracing is activated.
- Signed-in model-selection acceptance, provider billing/spend-stop evidence, and the
  retained GCP/Neon maintenance proofs remain operational follow-ups rather than repository
  implementation gates.
- Continue watching Aegra multitask/stream-auth changes; delete local guards only after a
  pinned release passes the same protocol, isolation, browser, and recovery suites.

## How to dispatch

- **Read [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-chatbot-is-a-rag-evaluation-testbed.md) and
  [ADR-0003](../adr/0003-agent-code-changes-via-pr.md) first.** Purpose, then process:
  feature branch, PR, never a direct commit to `main`, never merge on red CI.
- Dispatch only an exact remaining gate from the phase-status table; do not repeat a
  completed build phase.
- Owner-reviewed evaluation publication and post-launch operational evidence may proceed
  independently in separate worktrees and PRs.
- Rebase before review when parallel work touches the same planning or governance files.
- Every phase ends with its acceptance check actually run, and the result stated plainly.
